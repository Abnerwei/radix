* Clean
  - CmdAction is ugly
    - the way Cluster.Do works is... iffy. Casting Action to CmdAction feels
      weird
    - If someone were to make a "RetryAction" kind of thing it would not play
      nicely with cluster
  - PubSub stuff is kind of a mess (in what way?)
    - PersistentPubSub(...) should maybe take in a ConnFunc?
  - do all the structs types in resp need to be structs?
  - Read through docs, ensure everything is clean and sensical
  - Read through code, make sure all code comments are correct
  - Don't use testify?
  - update/delete Makefile
* Documentation
  - Examples where necessary
  - Simplify
  - README
    - doc link obvs
    - Feature list
    - Benchmarks
