# Week 1
    * investigate using contexts

# Week 2
    * Cluster
      - Support ASK/MOVE
      - Finish testing
        - ASK (MOVED test is done already)
      - Move into root

# Week 3
  * cluster
    - Method like `WithMasters(func(string, radix.Conn) error) error`
  * Look into how WithMasters above correlates with other Client types, maybe we
    can modify the Client interface to do something like that, would make
    scanning easier

# Week (3?) 4
  * Figure out how to expose stats/errors from Clients

# Week 5 (and 6?)
  * Think of name, move to that repo
  * Load testing
    - against v2
    - against redigo

.... re-evaluate here

* Clean
  - All leftover TODOS
  - consistent Close behavior
  - CmdAction is ugly
  - PoolFunc naming is ugly
  - PubSub stuff is kind of a mess
  - Read through docs, ensure everything is clean and sensical
  - Read through code, make sure all code comments are correct
  - Don't use testify
* Documentation
  - Examples where necessary
  - Simplify
* Make okq use it
