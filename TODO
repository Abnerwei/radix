# Week
  * Think of name, move to that repo
  * Load testing
    - against v2
    - against redigo

.... re-evaluate here

* Clean
  - All leftover TODOS
  - consistent Close behavior, including blocking till fully closed
  - CmdAction is ugly
    - the way Cluster.Do works is... iffy. Casting Action to CmdAction feels
      weird
    - If someone were to make a "RetryAction" kind of thing it would not play
      nicely with cluster
  - PoolFunc naming is ugly
  - PubSub stuff is kind of a mess (in what way?)
  - do all the structs types in resp need to be structs?
  - Read through docs, ensure everything is clean and sensical
  - Read through code, make sure all code comments are correct
  - Don't use testify
  - https://blog.golang.org/subtests
* Documentation
  - Examples where necessary
  - Simplify
* Make okq use it
