* Make many types into interfaces
* Scanner interface is slightly different
* Pool uses a Done method on the ConnCmder it returns, instead of having a Put
  method
* Now use encoder/decoder, instead of returning Resp objects. This affects the
  Cmd interface as well as Pipeline, and anything that uses them directly (or
  probably indirectly).
